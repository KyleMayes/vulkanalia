# Conclusion

It has taken a lot of work to get to this point, but now you finally have a good base for a Vulkan program. The knowledge of the basic principles of Vulkan that you now possess should be sufficient to start exploring more of the features, like:

* Instanced rendering
* Dynamic uniforms
* Separate images and sampler descriptors
* Pipeline cache
* Multi-threaded command buffer generation
* Multiple subpasses
* Compute shaders

The current program can be extended in many ways, like adding Blinn-Phong lighting, post-processing effects and shadow mapping. You should be able to learn how these effects work from tutorials for other APIs, because despite Vulkan's explicitness, many concepts still work the same.
